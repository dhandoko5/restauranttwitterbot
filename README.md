# restauranttwitterbot
This restaurant recommendation Twitter bot will tweet you the top Yelp restaurant result for a given set of criteria. A tweet can be sent to @dhandoko5 with the following parameters:
- 5 digit zip code
- Price willing to pay ($)
- Type of cuisine

The restaurant bot will tweet back the top result given those criteria. 

When running the R script for the first time, please run the section of code starting with "#If first time running, run this code". All subsequent runs of the script should then ignore this section of code and run the section titled "#If not first time running, run this code".
